# Phase 21 Archive (Exploratory)

This folder contains exploratory scripts created during Phase 21 hardening.
They are retained for auditability, but are **not canonical**.

## Canonical artifacts (kept at scripts/ root)
- scripts/mcp_smoke_phase21.mjs (21A)
- scripts/mcp_smoke_phase21b.mjs (21B)
- scripts/mcp_smoke_phase21c.mjs (21C)
- scripts/patch_phase21c_per_tool_contract_gating_v1.mjs (21C)

## Archived artifacts
Anything moved here was either:
- a superseded patch iteration, or
- a one-off recovery script used during debugging.
